# ASA-AB-Notes

All explorer notes and dossiers in Ark: Survival Ascended
find the GameUserSettings.ini file in:
> \Steam\steamapps\common\ARK Survival Ascended\ShooterGame\Saved\Config\Windows

add the lines from Notes.txt to GameUserSettings.ini under header:
> [/Script/ShooterGame.ShooterGameUserSettings]

The waypoints are missing '??? Notes' and 'HLN-A Discoveries'.
They can be found at:
```

??? Note #9 - 47.6 21.8 The Ancient Device

```
IF anyone cares to create waypoint lines for them, please share with me, so I can add them to this repo.
